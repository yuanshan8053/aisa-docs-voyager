# Welcome to AIsa

> The unified API gateway for AI agents - live LLM and media model routing, 100+ data APIs, and stablecoin payments through one endpoint.

AIsa is the unified resource and payment layer for the AI economy. Route requests to the live catalog of GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, MiniMax, GLM, Seed, Seedream, and Wan models, access real-time web, financial, and social data from 100+ APIs, and let autonomous agents pay for their own compute - all through one API key.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="One API key, every model">
    Swap your `base_url` to AIsa and instantly access GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, MiniMax, GLM, Seed, Seedream, and Wan models. Most models use OpenAI-compatible chat completions; selected models also expose Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses, Gemini GenerateContent, or image-generation routes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="One gateway, every data source">
    Access 100+ specialized APIs - Twitter, Perplexity, Tavily, YouTube, stock prices, prediction markets - without managing separate vendor accounts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="One wallet, autonomous payments">
    Fund a single AIsa wallet with fiat or USDC. Every endpoint supports the x402 machine payment protocol, so agents can pay for compute and data on their own.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported models

AIsa is API-compatible with the OpenAI ecosystem for chat-style model calls, with additional provider-compatible routes where useful. Switch models without changing billing or key management - optimize for cost, speed, reasoning, coding, vision, audio, image generation, or long context on a per-request basis.
