### Agent Discovery Infrastructure

AIsa now publishes three machine-readable discovery endpoints so autonomous agents can find, authenticate with, and invoke AIsa's capabilities without human intervention.

| Endpoint           | URL                            | Protocol         |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------- |
| A2A Agent Card     | `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | Google A2A       |
| AI Plugin Manifest | `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json`  | OpenAI Plugin v1 |
| OpenAPI Spec       | `/openapi.yaml`                | OpenAPI 3.1.0    |

All three endpoints include permissive CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) so browser-based agents and web applications can fetch them directly. The agent card advertises 13 skills with tags, descriptions, and example queries for programmatic skill matching.

### Developer Tools on aisa.one

The main website now includes two new developer-facing pages and an updated navigation structure:

**API Explorer** — An interactive Swagger UI at [aisa.one/api-explorer](https://aisa.one/api-explorer) for browsing, testing, and integrating with all 111+ AIsa endpoints directly in the browser. Supports persistent authorization and live request execution.

**Agent Discovery Page** — A visual skill explorer at [aisa.one/agent-discovery](https://aisa.one/agent-discovery) with search and tag filtering across all 13 skills, integration code examples in Python, TypeScript, and cURL, and a live "Try It" sandbox for testing the discovery-to-invocation flow.

**Developers Dropdown** — The navbar now features a "Developers" dropdown with quick links to Documentation, API Explorer, Agent Discovery, and the OpenAPI Spec.

### OpenAPI Auto-Sync

A new GitHub Actions workflow automatically consolidates individual OpenAPI specs from the docs repo, validates the generated `openapi.yaml`, and syncs it to the website repository. Slack notifications report success, no-change, or failure outcomes.

### URL Migration

All documentation URLs have been migrated from `docs.aisa.one` to `aisa.one/docs`, and `marketplace.aisa.one` has been replaced with `console.aisa.one`. Existing links redirect automatically.

### Financial API Additions

Two new endpoints have been added to the Financial Data API:

| Endpoint                                 | Description                                                          |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /apis/v1/financial/prices/snapshot` | Batch price snapshot for multiple tickers in a single request        |
| `GET /apis/v1/financial/earnings`        | Earnings data including EPS actuals, estimates, and surprise metrics |

The Financial API reference pages have been reorganized by canonical tag for easier navigation, and macro interest rate pages are now grouped under a dedicated "Interest Rates" subheader.

### Prediction Market Fixes

Several improvements to the Polymarket and Kalshi API documentation:

The Polymarket candlestick and wallet PnL endpoints have been corrected to use query parameters instead of path parameters, matching the actual API behavior. Missing query parameters `condition_id` and `wallet_address` have been added to the relevant endpoints. The pagination example link in the Polymarket spec has been updated to point to the correct location.

### Analyst Estimates Correction

The analyst estimates endpoint has been renamed from "Earnings Per Share" to "Analyst Estimates" to accurately reflect its content. The description has been updated to remove references to price targets and analyst counts that are not returned by the endpoint.

### Video Generation — All 4 Wan Models

The video generation documentation has been expanded to cover all four Wan 2.7 model variants:

| Model                 | Type           | Resolution |
| :-------------------- | :------------- | :--------- |
| `wan2.7-t2v-1.3B`     | Text-to-video  | 480p       |
| `wan2.7-t2v-14B`      | Text-to-video  | 720p       |
| `wan2.7-i2v-480p-14B` | Image-to-video | 480p       |
| `wan2.7-i2v-720p-14B` | Image-to-video | 720p       |

### Navigation Restructure

Documentation tab slugs have been flattened to `/guides`, `/api-reference`, and `/agent-skills` for cleaner URLs and improved navigation.

### Image Generation Endpoints

Two new image generation pages have been added to the API reference:

**Image Generation via Chat** — Generate images using the `wan2.7-image` model family through the standard `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This allows image generation within the same conversational interface used for text.

**OpenAI-Compatible Image Generations** — Generate images using SeedREAM through the `/v1/images/generations` endpoint, fully compatible with the OpenAI Images API format.

The video task-status endpoint has been corrected to use a path parameter for the task ID, matching the actual API behavior.

### Twitter/X Action Endpoints

Six new Twitter/X action endpoints are now available, enabling full read-write automation:

| Endpoint                            | Method | Description            |
| :---------------------------------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/follow_twitter`   | POST   | Follow a user          |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/unfollow_twitter` | POST   | Unfollow a user        |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/post_twitter`     | POST   | Post a tweet           |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/like_twitter`     | POST   | Like a tweet           |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/unlike_twitter`   | POST   | Unlike a tweet         |
| `/apis/v1/twitter/auth_twitter`     | POST   | Initiate OAuth linking |

These endpoints complement the existing read-only Twitter search and profile endpoints, enabling autonomous agents to engage on Twitter/X programmatically.

### Documentation Platform Migration

The AIsa documentation has been migrated from ReadMe.com to Mintlify, bringing improved navigation, interactive API playground, and a cleaner reading experience. All existing documentation URLs continue to work through automatic redirects.

### Model Catalog Updates

The model families table on the welcome page has been updated to reflect the current catalog. Pricing documentation has been clarified to note that Anthropic models are available at provider rates rather than discounted rates.

### Housekeeping

Several orphaned OpenAPI specification files have been removed, including stale v2 Twitter specs and unused Jina AI specs. This cleanup reduces repository size and prevents confusion with outdated endpoint definitions.
