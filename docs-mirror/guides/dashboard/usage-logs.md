# Usage Logs – Track API Requests, Tokens & Billing

The Usage Logs page provides a complete history of activity associated with your account. It records API requests, token consumption, billing details, and important system-level actions, allowing you to monitor usage, verify costs, and audit account events in one place.

This page is useful for:

* Tracking API consumption and spend
* Reviewing token usage per request
* Monitoring request performance
* Auditing activity across groups or API keys
* Investigating unexpected charges or system actions

## What Is Recorded

The Usage Logs include both API activity and key platform events.

### API Requests

All requests made through:

* API keys
* Playground
* LLM inference APIs
* Per-call APIs (Search, Financial, YouTube, Scholar, Twitter, and others)

For each request, the log captures usage, performance, and billing information.

### System & Account Events

Important account-level actions are also recorded. For example:

* Enabling two-factor authentication
* Security-related configuration changes

These entries appear as system events and are included for auditing purposes. They typically do not incur usage charges.

## Overview Metrics

At the top of the page, summary metrics are displayed for the selected time range.

**Used Quota**\
Shows the total quota consumed during the selected period.

**RPM (Requests per Minute)**\
Indicates the rate of incoming requests.

**TPM (Tokens per Minute)**\
Indicates the rate of token consumption.

These metrics help identify traffic spikes and overall usage patterns.

## Filtering and Search

Usage logs can be filtered to narrow down results.

Available filters include:

* **Date and time range**
* **Group**
* **Token Name**
* **Model Name**

Click **Query** to apply filters and **Reset** to clear them.

Column visibility can be adjusted using **Column settings**.

## Log Table Columns

Each row in the table represents a single event, either an API request or a system action.

**Time**

The timestamp when the event occurred.

**Tokens**

The API key used for the request. This field may be empty for system events.

**Group**

The workspace group associated with the API key.

### Type

Indicates the request type.

For example:

* ***Consume*** – A standard API request consuming tokens
* ***System*** – an account or platform-level action

**Model**

The model used to process the request (for LLM calls).

**Time / First Word**

Performance details for supported API requests, including:

* Total request duration
* Time to first response token
* Whether the response was streamed

**Input / Output**

Number of input and output tokens consumed (for LLM requests).

**Spend**

The cost associated with the event:

* Token-based cost for LLM requests
* Fixed per-call cost for per-call APIs
* Typically no cost for system events

**IP**

The source IP address associated with the request, if available.

Only when the user sets IP recording, the IP recording of request and error type logs will be performed

**Details**

Additional information, such as applied pricing ratios or a description of the system event.

## Viewing Log Details

Clicking a log entry expands a detailed breakdown.

The expanded view includes:

### Model Ratio and Cache Ratio

Displays model-specific billing multipliers applied to the request.

Example fields may include:

* Model ratio
* Cache ratio
* Completion ratio
* Group ratio

### Billing Process

The billing breakdown shows how cost is calculated.

This includes:

* Input token price per 1M tokens
* Output token price per 1M tokens
* Multipliers applied
* Final calculated spend

The detailed formula is shown for transparency. Actual account deduction reflects the final calculated amount.

### Request Path

Displays the internal API route used to process the request.

Example: `/pg/chat/completions`

This helps identify which endpoint was used.

This breakdown provides full transparency into how the final cost was calculated.

For system events, the expanded view describes the action performed.

## How Billing Is Reflected

Usage costs are calculated based on:

* Token consumption (for LLM APIs)
* Fixed per-call pricing (for non-LLM APIs)
* Applicable model or group pricing rules

The Usage Logs show the calculated cost per event. The actual account balance deduction reflects the final computed amount.

## Practical Use Cases

The Usage Logs page is helpful for:

* Verifying token consumption per request

* Tracking which models are being used

* Auditing cost distribution across groups

* Debugging unexpected billing behavior

* Reviewing request latency and streaming performance

## Notes

* All Playground activity appears in Usage Logs.

* All API key requests appear in Usage Logs.

* System-level actions are recorded for audit visibility.

* Costs shown in the log are deducted from the account balance where applicable.
