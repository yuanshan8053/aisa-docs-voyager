<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/ff64679b-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120106.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=9d4d0521eb33fe0be927c22e6b7f38ba" alt="AIsa wallet dashboard showing account balance, total credits, and usage summary" width="1913" height="1108" data-path="images/ff64679b-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120106.png" />

The Wallet page is where you manage your account balance, fund your usage, and track incoming payments and rewards. Since AIsa operates on a usage-based billing model, your wallet balance is used to cover API consumption across AI models and per-call endpoints.

Maintaining a sufficient balance ensures uninterrupted access to the platform.

## Account Overview

At the top of the Wallet page, you’ll find a summary of your account’s financial activity. This includes:

* **Current balance:** The amount currently available for API usage
* **Used amount:** The total amount already spent
* **Number of requests:** The total number of API calls made

Together, these metrics provide a quick snapshot of usage and spending.

## Funding Your Account

To continue using AIsa services, you can top up your balance at any time. The platform supports two payment methods:

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/5135f991-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120143.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=3a0386cc392b4627a26ecb26a33af79d" alt="Payment method selection screen with options for credit card via Stripe or stablecoin deposit" width="1919" height="1111" data-path="images/5135f991-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120143.png" />

* Card payments processed via **Stripe**
* Stablecoin payments handled through AIsa’s native crypto payment system

Both methods credit funds to your wallet once the payment is successfully confirmed.

In addition to custom amounts, predefined recharge tiers are available and may include volume-based discounts.

## Top-Up Amounts and Volume Discounts

You may either enter a custom top-up amount or select from predefined recharge tiers. Larger top-ups qualify for discounted pricing.

For example:

* \$50 → 5% discount
* \$100 → 5% discount
* \$200 → 10% discount
* \$500 → 15% discount
* \$1000 → 20% discount

When selecting a discounted tier, the confirmation screen clearly displays:

* The original amount
* The discount applied
* The final payable amount

The credited balance reflects the discounted payment once the transaction is successfully confirmed.

## Adding Credits to Your Wallet

Below is the complete step-by-step process for funding your account.

### Step 1: Select a Top-Up Amount

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/145233b5-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120106.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=3c46d637869374efe65c5c0ad35e2ca9" alt="Top-up interface showing a custom amount input field and preset credit tier buttons" width="1913" height="1108" data-path="images/145233b5-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120106.png" />

On the Wallet page, either:

* Enter a custom amount in the **Top-up Amount (USD)** field, or
* Select one of the predefined recharge tiers

After choosing your desired amount, click **Submit** to proceed.

### Step 2: Review the Top-Up Confirmation

A **Top Up Confirmation** modal appears before payment is processed.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/bb6a2df4-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120143.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=857434b16b1b1e91c7db860cb5495b37" alt="Payment confirmation dialog showing the selected amount, any volume discount applied, and final charge total" width="1919" height="1111" data-path="images/bb6a2df4-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120143.png" />

This screen displays:

* Actual payment amount
* Original price
* Discount applied (if any)
* Connected wallet (for stablecoin payments)
* Spending limit (for stablecoin payments)

This step ensures you clearly understand the final payable amount before continuing.

From here, you can choose your preferred payment method:

* **Pay with Card**
* **Pay with Stablecoin**

## Card Payment Flow (Stripe)

If you select **Pay with Card**, the following process occurs:

### Step 3: Stripe Checkout

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/e9645047-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120155.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=68cd55c33f625aed899f584bf7dc633f" alt="Stripe secure checkout page for completing credit card payment to fund AIsa account" width="1002" height="691" data-path="images/e9645047-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120155.png" />

You are redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page where you:

* Choose your preferred currency (if supported)
* Enter card details
* Provide billing information
* Confirm the payment

Stripe processes the transaction securely.

### Step 4: Confirmation and Balance Update

Once the payment is successfully processed:

* The transaction is recorded in the **Deposits** section
* The deposit status updates accordingly
* Your wallet balance is credited automatically

Card payments are typically confirmed immediately upon success.

## Stablecoin Payment Flow

If you select **Pay with Stablecoin**, the process includes wallet authorization and blockchain confirmation.

### Step 3: Connect Wallet

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/5d2262a6-Screenshot_2026-02-18_125046.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=68772ae104de2eb1a6bfd4b933fc4169" alt="Wallet connection prompt showing supported crypto wallets for stablecoin payment" width="1919" height="1111" data-path="images/5d2262a6-Screenshot_2026-02-18_125046.png" />

If not already connected, you will be prompted to connect a supported wallet such as:

* MetaMask
* WalletConnect
* Rainbow
* OKX Wallet

Once connected, the wallet address appears in the confirmation modal.

### Step 4: Approve Spending Cap

Before transferring funds, you must approve a **spending cap request**. This allows the platform to withdraw the specified amount of the specified stablecoin (for example, USDC) from your wallet.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/740a3aa2-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120453.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=e6840e072c40a292319bd57dd728544d" alt="Blockchain spending authorization dialog showing the approval amount and estimated network gas fee" width="1838" height="1110" data-path="images/740a3aa2-Screenshot_2026-02-18_120453.png" />

Your wallet interface will display:

* The spending cap amount
* The network
* The token being used
* Estimated network fees

You must approve this transaction before proceeding.

### Step 5: Confirm the Payment Transaction

After approving the spending cap:

* You confirm the actual transfer transaction
* The blockchain processes the payment
* Network fees may apply depending on chain conditions

Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, the deposit is marked as completed.

## Tracking Deposits and Payment Status

All funding activity is recorded in the **Deposits** section.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/aisa/vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA/images/a9c01959-image.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=vBu2Gxq6Yg6NR9cA&q=85&s=80002c9ffb13a3ed5d8338eda16f4e44" alt="Deposit history table showing past transactions with date, amount, payment method, and status columns" width="1919" height="1110" data-path="images/a9c01959-image.png" />

Each deposit entry includes:

* Order number
* Payment method
* Top-up quota
* Payment amount
* Status (such as Pending, Completed, or Expired)
* Creation time

Only completed deposits are credited to your wallet balance. Pending or expired transactions will not affect your available funds.

This section provides full visibility into funding history and ensures transparent tracking of all payments.

## Invite Friends & Earn Rewards

In addition to direct funding, AIsa offers a referral program that allows you to earn rewards by inviting others to the platform.

You can share your unique invite link with friends or colleagues. When they sign up and recharge their accounts, you earn rewards.

The Wallet page displays:

* Pending earnings
* Total rewards earned
* Number of invited users

Rewards can be transferred to your main balance at any time using the **Transfer to balance** option.

## How Wallet Balance Is Used

Your wallet balance is automatically deducted when you make billable API requests. This includes:

* Token-based AI model usage
* Per-call API usage
* Any other billable platform activity

Each deduction is recorded in the **[Usage Logs](https://aisa.one/docs/guides/dashboard/usage-logs)**, where you can review detailed cost breakdowns and billing calculations.

## Important Notes

* Payments are processed through Stripe or supported stablecoin networks.
* Discounts apply only to eligible recharge tiers.
* Funds are credited only after successful payment confirmation.
* API access may be interrupted if your balance is insufficient.
* All funding and spending activity can be audited through Wallet and Usage Logs.
