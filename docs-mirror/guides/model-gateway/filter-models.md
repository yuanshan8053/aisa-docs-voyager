# Filter Models

> Narrow down the live AIsa model catalog by provider, capability, quick presets, endpoint path, and keyword search to find the right model for your task.

The Model Gateway at [aisa.one/models](https://aisa.one/models) is the live catalog of every model AIsa routes to. It is backed by the current pricing and availability feed, so filters let you slice the catalog by provider, capability, endpoint, use case, and free-text search without relying on a stale static list.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open Model Gateway" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" href="https://aisa.one/models">
    Browse the live catalog with all filters available.

    Put two or three models side-by-side and share the result.

## Filter types

Four filter sets combine (AND logic across sets, OR within a set) to narrow the result list.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter by Provider">
    Click any provider chip - **Alibaba**, **Anthropic**, **ByteDance**, **DeepSeek**, **Google Gemini**, **MiniMax**, **Moonshot**, **OpenAI**, **xAI**, or **Zhipu GLM**. Each chip shows the current count of models for that provider.

    Toggle **Multi-select** (top-right of the provider row) to combine multiple providers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter by Capability">
    Choose what the model must support: **Text**, **Audio**, **Coding**, **Image**, **Video**, **Vision**. Selecting a capability also reveals sub-capabilities below the main row, such as `reasoning`, `long context`, `document vision`, `visual coding`, `speech-to-speech`, `image editing`, or `agentic coding`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quick Presets">
    Curated one-click filters for common use cases:

    * **Best for Coding** - reasoning + coding models ranked for software tasks
    * **Multimodal** - text + vision + audio/video understanding in one workflow
    * **Deep Reasoning** - models tagged for stronger reasoning
    * **Creative Writing** - models tuned for long-form generation
    * **Translation** - dedicated translation or multilingual models
    * **Image Generation** - Seedream, Wan, and GPT image models
    * **Voice & Audio** - speech-to-speech or audio-capable models
    * **Video** - video understanding or image-to-video capable models
    * **Budget-Friendly** - low-cost token models across providers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keyword Search">
    Free-text search at the top of the result list matches model names, providers, and endpoint paths. Examples: `gpt-5`, `claude`, `anthropic`, `/v1/messages`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Saving a filter

Once you've applied a combination, click **Save filter** to the right of the active filter chips. Your saved filter is preserved as a URL so you can bookmark it or share it with a teammate.

For example: [aisa.one/models?tags=vision](https://aisa.one/models?tags=vision) jumps straight to models currently tagged with vision support.

## Result view

Each model card in the result grid shows:

| Field          | What it is                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider logo  | Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.                      |
| Model ID       | The exact string to pass as `model` in API calls     |
| Endpoint       | Which AIsa endpoint path serves this model           |
| Input / Output | Price per 1M tokens (or flat price for media models) |
| Capabilities   | Text, Vision, Coding, etc. plus sub-capabilities     |
| Compare        | Click to add this model to the comparison dock       |

Switch between **grid** and **list** view using the toggle to the right of the search bar. Sort results with the dropdown - options include **Newest**, **Name (A-Z)**, **Price Low -> High**, **Price High -> Low**, and **Provider**.

## Tips

<Tip>
  The filter panel is stateful in the URL. Bookmark `?tags=coding,reasoning` or `?preset=budget-friendly` to jump back to a known slice.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  To start over, click **Clear** next to any active filter chip or **Clear all** above the result grid.
