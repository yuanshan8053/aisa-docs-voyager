# Compare Models

> Put 2-3 current AIsa models side-by-side to compare pricing, context windows, endpoints, capabilities, and cost estimates. Share the comparison as a link, image, or tweet.

Not sure whether `claude-opus-4-8`, `gpt-5.5`, `qwen3.7-max`, or `deepseek-v4-flash` is the right fit? The **Model Comparison** feature at [aisa.one/models](https://aisa.one/models) lets you stack up to three models side-by-side and share the result with a single click.

## How to compare

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add models to the comparison dock">
    From the result grid, click the **Compare** button on any model card. A floating dock appears at the bottom of the page showing the selected models as chips - `claude-opus-4-8`, `gpt-5.5`, `qwen3.7-max`, etc.

    You can add up to **3 models** per comparison. Remove one by clicking the `×` on its chip.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the comparison view">
    Click the orange **Compare** button in the dock. A full-screen modal opens with every model's specs in aligned columns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review side-by-side">
    The modal compares each model across every attribute that matters when choosing one:

    * **Provider** and **Model ID**
    * **Billing Type** (pay-as-you-go vs. flat)
    * **Input Price** and **Output Price** per 1M tokens
    * **Flat Price** (for media models)
    * **Context Window** (in tokens)
    * **Endpoint** (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`)
    * **Capabilities** + sub-capabilities
    * **Cost estimates** for three request sizes: 1K in + 1K out, 10K in + 2K out, 100K in + 10K out
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the comparison">
    Three share options appear at the top of the modal:

    * **Share Link** - copies a URL (e.g., `aisa.one/models?compare=13,20,27`). Anyone who opens it lands on the same comparison.
    * **Copy as Image** - renders the comparison as a PNG for dropping into Slack, decks, or docs.
    * **Twitter** - posts the comparison card straight to X.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example comparison

Comparing **claude-opus-4-8**, **gpt-5.5**, and **qwen3.7-max**:

| Spec               | claude-opus-4-8                        | gpt-5.5                                                 | qwen3.7-max            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Provider**       | Anthropic                              | OpenAI                                                  | Alibaba                |
| **Billing**        | Pay as you go                          | Pay as you go                                           | Pay as you go          |
| **Input / 1M**     | \$5.0000                               | \$5.0000                                                | \$1.1550               |
| **Output / 1M**    | \$25.0000                              | \$40.0000                                               | \$3.4657               |
| **Context window** | 1,000,000                              | 400,000                                                 | 1,000,000              |
| **Endpoint**       | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/chat/completions` | `/v1/messages`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses` | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| **Capabilities**   | Coding, Text, Vision                   | Coding, Text, Vision                                    | Coding, Text           |

**Cost estimate (1K in + 1K out):**
`$0.0300` vs. `$0.0450` vs. `$0.0046` -> `qwen3.7-max` is about **6.5x cheaper** than `claude-opus-4-8` and **9.7x cheaper** than `gpt-5.5` for this request size.

## Tips

<Tip>
  The URL `?compare=ID1,ID2,ID3` is the canonical share format. You can build it directly if you know the model IDs, or let the UI assemble it for you.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Copy as Image** produces a clean, branded comparison card. It's the fastest way to include a comparison in a presentation deck or blog post.
