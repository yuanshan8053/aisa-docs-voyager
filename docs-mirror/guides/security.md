# Security & Data Privacy – AIsa Unified LLM API

AIsa provides unified APIs across multiple AI and data providers, and is designed to minimize data persistence while enabling secure access to upstream services.

## Data Processing Model

AIsa processes API requests in real time to fulfill user requests.

* Requests are handled synchronously to route calls to the appropriate upstream provider
* Responses are returned directly to the client
* AIsa does not use user data for training or analytics

## Prompt and Output Retention

AIsa follows a **no-storage policy** for request content.

* **Prompts are not stored**
* **API responses and outputs are not stored**
* Request payloads are processed transiently and discarded after the request completes

This applies across all supported APIs, including AI models, embeddings, video, social platforms, web search, scholar, and finance integrations.

## Logging and Metadata

AIsa may retain **limited operational metadata** required to operate and protect the platform, such as:

* Request timestamps
* API key identifiers
* Rate-limiting counters
* Error and status information

This metadata:

* Does **not** include prompts, inputs, or generated outputs
* Is not used for model training or content analysis

## API Authentication

All AIsa APIs require authentication.

* Access is controlled using **API keys**
* Each request must include a valid API key
* Requests without valid authentication are rejected

Users are responsible for keeping API keys secure and rotating them as needed.

## Transport Security

AIsa APIs are accessed over secure network connections.

* API endpoints are served over HTTPS
* Secure transport is required for all requests and responses

Specific protocol versions and cryptographic configurations are managed at the infrastructure level and are not exposed publicly.

## Third-Party Providers

AIsa integrates with multiple upstream providers to deliver unified access through a single API.

* Requests are forwarded only as necessary to fulfill the API call
* AIsa does not persist the request content before or after forwarding
* Data handling by upstream providers is governed by their respective terms and policies

Users should review the policies of underlying providers when required by their use case.
