## When to use

* When the user needs web search results for a topic, question, company, product, or event
* When the user wants source discovery before summarizing, comparing, or validating information
* When the user needs current-news lookup with recent-day filtering
* When the user provides a public URL and wants the page content extracted for downstream analysis

## When NOT to use

* Do not use this skill for sites that require login, browser interaction, cookies, or private account access
* Do not use this skill for posting, social engagement, media upload, or OAuth-based workflows; it performs search and public-URL extraction only
* Do not use this skill when there is no network access to `https://aisa.one` or `https://api.aisa.one`

node scripts/extract.mjs "https://example.com/article"
```

## Setup

Requirements:

* `node`
* `AISA_API_KEY`
* Internet access with outbound requests to `https://aisa.one` and `https://api.aisa.one`

Auth, relay, and side-effect notes:

* This skill requires `AISA_API_KEY` from [https://console.aisa.one](https://console.aisa.one)
* Requests are sent through AIsa's remote relay at `https://aisa.one` and `https://api.aisa.one`
* This skill does not use OAuth
* This skill does not upload media or files
* This skill may send user search queries and public target URLs to the remote AIsa relay in order to return search results or extracted content

## Example Requests

* "Search for recent coverage of OpenAI enterprise pricing"
* "Find sources comparing vector databases for production RAG"
* "Look up this week's news about NVIDIA export controls"
* "Extract the main content from this article URL"

## Notes

* Needs `AISA_API_KEY` from [https://console.aisa.one](https://console.aisa.one)
* Powered by AIsa's unified API gateway (`https://aisa.one` / `https://api.aisa.one`)
* Use `--deep` for complex research questions
* Use `--topic news` for current events
* Search and extraction operate through remote relay requests, not local browser automation

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. Set your key and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli

   ```
4. Start a new agent session so the runtime loads the updated skill instructions.
