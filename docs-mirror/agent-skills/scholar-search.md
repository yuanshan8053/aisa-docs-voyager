## Setup

This skill requires the `AISA_API_KEY` environment variable. When installed as a Claude plugin, the key is configured via the plugin's `userConfig`.

## Usage

Run the search client with the `scholar` subcommand:

```bash theme={null}
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scholar-search/scripts/search_client.py scholar --query "<academic query>" --count <max_results> [--year-from YYYY] [--year-to YYYY]
```

### Arguments

| Argument         | Required | Default | Description                       |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--query` / `-q` | Yes      | —       | Academic search query             |
| `--count` / `-c` | No       | 10      | Maximum number of results (1–100) |
| `--year-from`    | No       | —       | Year lower bound (e.g., 2023)     |
| `--year-to`      | No       | —       | Year upper bound (e.g., 2026)     |

### Examples

```bash theme={null}
# Search for recent transformer papers
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scholar-search/scripts/search_client.py scholar --query "transformer architecture attention mechanism" --count 10 --year-from 2024

# Search papers in a specific year range
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scholar-search/scripts/search_client.py scholar --query "reinforcement learning from human feedback" --year-from 2022 --year-to 2025
```

## Output

The script prints structured academic results including:

* **Title** — Paper title
* **URL** — Link to the paper or abstract
* **Publication info** — Journal, conference, or preprint source
* **Snippet** — Abstract excerpt

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user needs academic papers, scholarly articles, research citations, or peer-reviewed sources. Best for literature reviews, citation lookups, and academic research tasks.

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. Set your key and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
   aisa skills install scholar-search
   ```
4. Start a new agent session so the runtime loads the updated skill instructions.
