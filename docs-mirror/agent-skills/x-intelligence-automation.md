## When to use

* The user wants Twitter/X research plus posting, liking, unliking, following, or unfollowing workflows.
* The task can use a Python client with `AISA_API_KEY` and explicit OAuth approval.
* The workflow needs a single package that covers read, post, and engagement actions.

## When NOT to use

* The user needs cookie extraction, password login, or a fully local Twitter client.
* The workflow must avoid relay-based network calls or media upload through `api.aisa.one`.
* The task needs undocumented secrets or browser-derived auth values.

## Quick Reference

* Required environment variable: `AISA_API_KEY`
* Read client: `scripts/twitter_client.py`
* Post client: `scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py`
* Engage client: `scripts/twitter_engagement_client.py`
* References: `references/post_twitter.md`, `references/engage_twitter.md`

## Setup

```bash theme={null}
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Common Commands

```bash theme={null}
python3 scripts/twitter_client.py search --query "AI agents" --type Latest
python3 scripts/twitter_oauth_client.py authorize
python3 scripts/twitter_engagement_client.py follow-user --user "@elonmusk"
```

## Capabilities

* Research Twitter/X accounts, tweets, trends, lists, communities, and Spaces.
* Publish text, image, and video posts after explicit OAuth approval.
* Like, unlike, follow, and unfollow after authorization exists.

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. Set your key and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
   aisa skills install x-intelligence-automation
   ```
4. Start a new agent session so the runtime loads the updated skill instructions.
