**Multi-source search for research tasks.** Query web, scholar, smart search, Tavily, and research-answer sources from one skill.

```

Then install the skill:

```bash theme={null}

## Setup

This skill requires the `AISA_API_KEY` environment variable. When installed as a Claude plugin, the key is configured via the plugin's `userConfig`.

## Usage

Run the search client with the `verity` subcommand:

```bash theme={null}
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/multi-search/scripts/search_client.py verity --query "<search query>" --count <results_per_source>
```

### Arguments

| Argument         | Required | Default | Description                       |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--query` / `-q` | Yes      | —       | Search query                      |
| `--count` / `-c` | No       | 5       | Maximum results per source (1–20) |

### Example

```bash theme={null}
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/multi-search/scripts/search_client.py verity --query "impact of AI on healthcare diagnostics" --count 5
```

## Output

The script prints:

1. **Individual results** from each source (Web, Smart, Scholar, Tavily)
2. **Confidence Assessment** with:
   * **Score** (0–100) — Overall confidence in the search results
   * **Level** — Very High / High / Medium / Low / Very Low
   * **Sources queried** and **Sources OK** — How many sources responded
   * **Total results** — Combined result count across all sources
3. **AI Synthesis** — A coherent summary combining insights from all sources, with citations

### Confidence Scoring Breakdown

| Factor              | Weight | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Source availability | 40%    | How many of the 4 sources returned results        |
| Result quality      | 35%    | Ratio of actual results to expected results       |
| Source diversity    | 15%    | Whether both academic and web sources are present |
| Recency bonus       | 10%    | Bonus for having at least one successful source   |

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user needs the most thorough and reliable search results possible. Best for fact-checking, comprehensive research, verifying claims across multiple sources, or any query where cross-source validation adds significant value. This tool is slower but more reliable than individual search tools.

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. Set your key and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
   aisa skills install multi-search
   ```
4. Start a new agent session so the runtime loads the updated skill instructions.
