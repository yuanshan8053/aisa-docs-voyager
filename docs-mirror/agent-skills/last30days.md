# Last 30 Days

> 30-day multi-source research for autonomous agents — ranked, clustered briefs with citations from Reddit, X, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Hacker News, Polymarket, GitHub, and grounded web search.

[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/AIsa-team/agent-skills/tree/main/last30days)

**Recent-evidence research across the social web.** One `AISA_API_KEY` aggregates the last 30 days of signal from eight platforms plus grounded web search, then ranks and clusters the findings into a citation-backed brief — typically in \~40 seconds.

## Install

First, install the AIsa CLI if you have not already:

```bash theme={null}
npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
```

Then install the skill:

```bash theme={null}
aisa skills install last30days
```

## Core capabilities

* **Eight sources in one call** — Reddit, X/Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Hacker News, Polymarket, and grounded web search (plus optional GitHub with a token)
* **Ranked evidence clusters** — top findings grouped by theme, each with URL, date, and engagement stats
* **Per-source breakdowns** — statistical summary of which platforms are driving the signal
* **Markdown or JSON output** — human-readable brief by default, structured JSON for agent pipelines
* **Deep mode** — `--deep` flag expands the candidate pool and runs a more thorough ranking pass
* **AIsa-native planning** — uses the AIsa API for query planning, candidate ranking, and semantic clustering

## Quick start

```bash theme={null}
export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### Run a scan

```bash theme={null}
# Trend scan
bash "${SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/run-last30days.sh" "OpenAI Agents SDK"

# Competitor comparison
bash "${SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/run-last30days.sh" "Claude Code vs Codex"

# Launch reaction (deep profile)
bash "${SKILL_ROOT}/scripts/run-last30days.sh" "GPT-5 launch --deep"
```

The output is a markdown brief containing the query plan, ranked candidates, semantic clusters, per-source items with dates / engagement / URLs, runtime details, and any error logs.

## When to use it

* Recent social evidence on trends, products, or people
* Ranked competitor comparisons with community sentiment
* Launch reaction summaries or shipping updates
* Structured JSON briefs for downstream agents

## When not to use it

* Timeless reference questions without a recent-evidence need
* Scenarios that require a single official source without community signal

## Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* `AISA_API_KEY` ([sign up at aisa.one](https://aisa.one) — new accounts start with \$2 free credit)
* POSIX shell
* Optional: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for expanded GitHub source coverage

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. `export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"` and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
   aisa skills install last30days
   ```
4. Start a new session in your agent — the skill loads automatically.
