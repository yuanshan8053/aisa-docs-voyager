```

Then install the skill:

```bash theme={null}

## Setup

This skill requires the `AISA_API_KEY` environment variable. When installed as a Claude plugin, the key is configured via the plugin's `userConfig`.

## Usage

Run the search client with the `smart` subcommand:

```bash theme={null}
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/smart-search/scripts/search_client.py smart --query "<search query>" --count <max_results>
```

### Arguments

| Argument         | Required | Default | Description                       |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--query` / `-q` | Yes      | —       | Search query                      |
| `--count` / `-c` | No       | 10      | Maximum number of results (1–100) |

### Example

```bash theme={null}
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/smart-search/scripts/search_client.py smart --query "impact of large language models on software engineering" --count 10
```

## Output

The script prints a mixed set of results from both web and academic sources, including titles, URLs, and content snippets.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user's query spans both general knowledge and academic research. For example, questions about emerging technologies, scientific topics with practical applications, or any query where both web articles and papers would be valuable.

## Get started

1. Sign up at [aisa.one](https://aisa.one) (new accounts start with \$2 free credit).
2. Generate an API key from the console.
3. Set your key and install the skill:
   ```bash theme={null}
   export AISA_API_KEY="your-key"
   npm install -g @aisa-one/cli
   aisa skills install smart-search
   ```
4. Start a new agent session so the runtime loads the updated skill instructions.
